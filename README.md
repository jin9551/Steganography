Purpose and Goals
=================

PURPOSE:
--------
The purpose of our project was to hide and extract a data in a binary image using Run Length Encoding.

GOALS:
--------
Implementation of Run-length encoding on a binary image
Learn how to extract a data without destroying it.


PROCESS & RESULT :
--------

# 1. Cover Image & Hidden Message(image) :

# 2. Compressed Binary Image & Stego Image :

# 3. Original Image & Stego Image :

Security, Capacity, and Robustness
------------------------------------

# Security:
You can not see any distortion in the image. (Imperceptibility)
Though the file size of the cover image changed drastically.
98,056 bytes â†’ 350,139 bytes

# Robustness:
Recovered image from the encoded.png lost some details but we managed to extract the image successfully.

# Capacity:
As long as the size of the hidden image is equal to the cover image, you can hide anything.
